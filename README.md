## Features

- Lots of customisation options

  - 2 Main Menu Styles
  - 6 Fonts
  - Multiple health/ammo positions and styles
  - Optional uber tracker and speedometer
  - And even more!

- A large focus on being easy to read even in the most intense moments.

- Support for 16:9 and 4:3. (If you run into any issues on either resolution let me know!)

- And a lot more features to come through updates and continued support.

I am creating this HUD with the idea of clarity, less background borders/boxes and removing options that are not important for competitive TF2.
If the HUD has issues in casual or other modes that would be only be fixed at the expense of competitive 6v6/highlander; I will always prioritise competitive.
